inspection.assert=TornadoVM: Assert statement is not supported.
inspection.datatype=TornadoVM:Unsupported datatype in TornadoVM.
inspection.externalLibrary=TornadoInsight is currently unable to check for non-JDK method calls
inspection.recursion=TornadoVM: Recursive calls are not allowed in a method with @Reduce or @Parallel parameters
inspection.staticTaskGraph=TornadoVM: TornadoVM currently does not support static TaskGraph and Tasks
inspection.nativeCall=TornadoVM: TornadoVM does not support native calls

# ui
ui.settings.comment.env=The environment variable file for TornadoVM is usually \"TornadoVM/setvars.sh\". \
  This file allows the plugin to call your host's TornadoVM for further analysis of TornadoVM methods.
ui.settings.max.array.size=Max array size specifies the length of Java variables when automatically initialized \
  by TornadoInsight. For example, when the parameter size is set to 32, and the type of a \
  parameter in a TornadoVM task is IntArray, TornadoInsight creates an IntArray of length 32 \
  and fills it with random values.
ui.settings.comment.debug.file=Saves an internally generated file for debugging purposes. This feature is not intended for regular users.
ui.settings.label.tornado=TornadoVM root:
ui.settings.label.java=Path to Java 21:
ui.setting.label.size=Max array size:
ui.settings.group.runtime=TornadoVM Runtime

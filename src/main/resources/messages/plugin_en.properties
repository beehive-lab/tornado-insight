# ui
ui.settings.comment.env=The environment variable file for TornadoVM is usually \"TornadoVM/setvars.sh\". \
  This file allows the plugin to call your host's TornadoVM for further analysis of TornadoVM methods.
ui.settings.max.array.size=Max array size specifies the length of Java variables when automatically initialized \
  by TornadoInsight. For example, when the parameter size is set to 32, and the type of a \
  parameter in a TornadoVM task is IntArray, TornadoInsight creates an IntArray of length 32 \
  and fills it with random values.
ui.settings.tensor.shape.dimensions.doc=Tensor shape dimensions define the dimensions of a TornadoVM tensor type as a list of integer values separated by commas. For example, to set a three-dimensional shape: 16, 1, 1.
ui.settings.comment.debug.file=Saves an internally generated file for debugging purposes. This feature is not intended for regular users.
